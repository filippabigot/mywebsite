            This is a webpage about me, Filippa. I was born in 2000 and I'm a
            second year student at JTH, where i study New Media Design. Here i
            will show you some of my work, together with some good-to-know
            information about Jönköping City.

            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            <p>
              I'm a 23 year old girl born and raised in Gothenburg. I've spent
              most of my years living with my family of four in a small town
              called Lerum. Since 2 years, I've been living in Jönköping and I
              have grown fond of the city and its activities. I grew up
              horseback riding and dancing, things I unfortunately had to leave
              behind while moving.
